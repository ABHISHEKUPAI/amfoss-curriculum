Through git exercise the main important conscept i reversed are :- 

git merge:
Combines changes from one branch into another, preserving both branches’ commit history.

git rebase:
Moves or reapplies commits from one branch onto another, creating a cleaner, linear history.

git commit --amend:
Modifies the most recent commit — useful for fixing messages or adding forgotten changes.

git bisect:
Automatically finds the commit that introduced a bug by testing commits between a known good and bad version.

git reset:
Moves the current branch pointer to a specific commit, optionally changing your working directory and staging area — used to undo commits or unstage changes.
